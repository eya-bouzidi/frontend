## [13.0.0](https://github.com/npm/cacache/compare/v12.0.3...v13.0.0) (2019-09-25)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* This subtly changes the streaming interface of
everything in cacache that streams, which is, well, everything in
cacache.  Most users will probably not notice, but any code that
depended on stream behavior always being deferred until next tick will
need to adjust.

The mississippi methods 'to', 'from', 'through', and so on, have been
replaced with their Minipass counterparts, and streaming interaction
with the file system is done via fs-minipass.

The following modules are of interest here:

- [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) The core stream library.

- [fs-minipass](http://npm.im/fs-minipass)  Note that the 'WriteStream'
  class from fs-minipass is _not_ a Minipass stream, but rather a plain
  old EventEmitter that duck types as a Writable.

- [minipass-collect](http://npm.im/minipass-collect) Gather up all the
  data from a stream.  Cacache only uses Collect.PassThrough, which is a
  basic Minipass passthrough stream which emits a 'collect' event with
  the completed data just before the 'end' event.

- [minipass-pipeline](http://npm.im/minipass-pipeline) Connect one or
  more streams into a pipe chain.  Errors anywhere in the pipeline are
  proxied down the chain and then up to the Pipeline object itself.
  Writes go into the head, reads go to the tail.  Used in place of
  pump() and pumpify().

- [minipass-flush](http://npm.im/minipass-flush) A Minipass passthrough
  stream that defers its 'end' event until after a flush() method has
  completed (either calling the supplied callback, or returning a
  promise.)  Use in place of flush-write-stream (aka mississippi.to).

Streams from through2, concat-stream, and the behavior provided by
end-of-stream are all implemented in Minipass itself.

Features of interest to cacache, which make Minipass a particularly good
fit:

- All of the 'endish' events are normalized, so we can just listen on
  'end' and know that finish, prefinish, and close will be handled as
  well.
- Minipass doesn't waste time [containing
  zalgo](https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony).
- Minipass has built-in support for promises that indicate the end or
  error: stream.promise(), stream.collect(), and stream.concat().
- With reliable and consistent timing guarantees, much less
  error-checking logic is required.  We can be more confident that an
  error is being thrown or emitted in the correct place, rather than in
  a callback which is deferred, resulting in a hung promise or
  uncaughtException.

The biggest downside of Minipass is that it lacks some of the internal
characteristics of node-core streams, which many community modules use
to identify streams.  They have no _writableState or _readableState
objects, or _read or _write methods.  As a result, the is-stream module
(at least, at the time of this commit) doesn't recognize Minipass
streams as readable or writable streams.

All in all, the changes required of downstream users should be minimal,
but are unlikely to be zero.  Hence the semver major change.

* **deps** Abstracted out `lib/util/infer-owner.js` to
  [@npmcli/infer-owner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@npmcli/infer-owner)
  so that it could be more easily used in other parts of the npm CLI.


## [12.0.0](https://github.com/npm/cacache/compare/v11.3.3...v12.0.0) (2019-07-15)


### Features

* infer uid/gid instead of accepting as options ([ac84d14](https://github.com/npm/cacache/commit/ac84d14))
* **i18n:** add another error message ([676cb32](https://github.com/npm/cacache/commit/676cb32))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* the uid gid options are no longer respected or
necessary.  As of this change, cacache will always match the cache
contents to the ownership of the cache directory (or its parent
directory), regardless of what the caller passes in.

Reasoning:

The number one reason to use a uid or gid option was to keep root-owned
files from causing problems in the cache.  In npm's case, this meant
that CLI's ./lib/command.js had to work out the appropriate uid and gid,
then pass it to the libnpmcommand module, which had to in turn pass the
uid and gid to npm-registry-fetch, which then passed it to
make-fetch-happen, which passed it to cacache.  (For package fetching,
pacote would be in that mix as well.)

Added to that, `cacache.rm()` will actually _write_ a file into the
cache index, but has no way to accept an option so that its call to
entry-index.js will write the index with the appropriate uid/gid.
Little ownership bugs were all over the place, and tricky to trace
through.  (Why should make-fetch-happen even care about accepting or
passing uids and gids?  It's an http library.)

This change allows us to keep the cache from having mixed ownership in
any situation.

Of course, this _does_ mean that if you have a root-owned but
user-writable folder (for example, `/tmp`), then the cache will try to
chown everything to root.

The solution is for the user to create a folder, make it user-owned, and
use that, rather than relying on cacache to create the root cache folder.

If we decide to restore the uid/gid opts, and use ownership inference
only when uid/gid are unset, then take care to also make rm take an
option object, and pass it through to entry-index.js.
